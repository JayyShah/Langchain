# LLMs in general:

- LLMs are deep learning models with billions of parameters that excel at a wide range of natural language processing tasks. They can perform tasks like translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbot conversations without being specifically trained for them. LLMs can be used without fine-tuning by employing "prompting" techniques, where a question is presented as a text prompt with examples of similar problems and solutions.

## Architecture

- LLMs typically consist of multiple layers of neural networks, feedforward layers, embedding layers, and attention layers. These layers work together to process input text and generate output predictions.

## Future implications:

- While LLMs have the potential to revolutionize various industries, it is important to be aware of their limitations and ethical implications. Businesses and workers should carefully consider the trade-offs and risks associated with using LLMs, and developers should continue refining these models to minimize biases and improve their usefulness in different applications.

## Maximum Number of Tokens

- In the LangChain library, the LLM context size, or the maximum number of tokens the model can process, is determined by the specific implementation of the LLM. 

- For example, if you’re using the GPT-3 model, the maximum number of tokens supported by the model is 2,049. The max tokens for different models depend on the specific version and their variants. (e.g., davinci, curie, babbage, or ada) Each version has different limitations, with higher versions typically supporting larger number of tokens.

- It is important to ensure that the input text does not exceed the maximum number of tokens supported by the model, as this may result in truncation or errors during processing. To handle this, you can split the input text into smaller chunks and process them separately, making sure that each chunk is within the allowed token limit. You can then combine the results as needed.

```python

from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# Before executing the following code, make sure to have
# your OpenAI key saved in the “OPENAI_API_KEY” environment variable.
# Initialize the LLM
llm = OpenAI(model_name="text-davinci-003")

# Define the input text
input_text = "your_long_input_text"

# Determine the maximum number of tokens from documentation
max_tokens = 4097

# Split the input text into chunks based on the max tokens
text_chunks = split_text_into_chunks(input_text, max_tokens)

# Process each chunk separately
results = []
for chunk in text_chunks:
    result = llm.process(chunk)
    results.append(result)

# Combine the results as needed
final_result = combine_results(results)

```

- split_text_into_chunks and combine_results are custom functions that you would need to implement based on your specific requirements.

- The key takeaway is to ensure that the input text does not exceed the maximum number of tokens supported by the model.

*Note that splitting into multiple chunks can hurt the coherence of the text*
